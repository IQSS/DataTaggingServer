# SamplePoMoSClientApp

This is a very simple web application that can request an interview from a PolicyModelsServer, and present the user with the result. This application is intended as a reference for people who need to write such clients.

# How to run this

You'll need:

* [SBT](https://www.scala-sbt.org/index.html)
* A running [PolicyModels Server](https://github.com/IQSS/DataTaggingServer/) running somewhere it can post back to this app (easy option: on the same computer).
